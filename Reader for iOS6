I used the original PDF Reader code to embed in my project and in the process I converted the code to:
  - use UIPageViewController
  - use UIToolBar to generate the MainToolBar
  - Accept one custom button on MainToolBar when creating a new ReaderViewController
  
  There are still some bugs to fix:
    - PDF page is not shown in full screen mode, it is shown below the MainToolBar on the iPhone
    - buttons on MainToolbar are not too nice because how UIBarButtonItem renders the images
    - font used on left button on MainToolBar is too big

    
  Possible improvements:
    - cleanup code to remove unused view layout calculations not needed
    - iPad view to use 2 page mode of UIpageViewController in landscape mode
    - Use split view in iPad to show TOC and pages
    - Add search field on MainToolBar
